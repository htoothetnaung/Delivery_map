# Project Overview

# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive map-based delivery management system that provides real-time tracking and route optimization capabilities. It enables organizations to efficiently monitor deliveries, streamline logistics operations, and enhance decision-making through automated processes. The system significantly reduces human errors and manual interventions while improving overall operational efficiency.


## Mock Backend

To simulate backend functionality, the project uses `json-server`. This allows you to interact with mock data stored in `src/mock/db.json`.

To start the mock server, run the following command:

```sh
npx json-server --watch src/mock/db.json --port 3001
```

## Run FrontEnd

```sh
npm run dev
```
